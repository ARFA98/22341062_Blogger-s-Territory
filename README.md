I have created a personal blog site because it is way more special and specified than the hyped social media like facebook, twitter and so on. Social media like facebook and twitter has become a platform where people share their lifestyle in an informal way. We can not filter out a topic easily as information is not categorized there. On the other hand, one will be able to categorize information in a blog site with the different topics. So, it is way more convenient for people to search something. Moreover, it will also help people to do survey on the exact topic by searching. The project will be built using JavaScript MVC architecture. My initial plan is to use bootstrap for front-end. Every user will be able to create a profile that better suites their personality by registering. They will create article and blog based on different topics. Also, they will be able to personalize their dashboard depending on their field of interest.
